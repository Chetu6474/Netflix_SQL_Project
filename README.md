# **Netflix Data Analysis Project**  

## **ðŸ“– Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze Netflix data using **PostgreSQL** and **Excel**, with additional **data visualizations** to gain insights.  
The dataset contains over **8,500 records**, and various business problems are addressed using SQL queries and analytical techniques.  

---

## **ðŸ›  Tech Stack Used**  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Data Processing**: Excel   

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow**  

### **Step 1: Database Creation & Data Import**  
1. Created a PostgreSQL database named **`Netflix_db`**.  
2. Defined table names and assigned appropriate **data types** to store values.  
3. Imported data from a CSV file into the database.  
4. Performed initial exploration to understand the dataset before diving into business problems.
